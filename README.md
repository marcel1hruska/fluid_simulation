# Fluid simulation using Shallow Water Equation

WIP!

Basic Water simulation implemented. User can rotate camera using mouse and WASD around a small blue grid representing water.
By tapping right mouse button on the water (not working properly yet), a user can add pressure to the water which creates waves.
